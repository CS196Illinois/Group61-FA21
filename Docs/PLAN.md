Build a game with a basic level design. Our game will include a mini-boss and a final boss with a combat system and weapons that can be equipped.

We need to create a flat level terrain using Unity and then add in our playable character, movement scripts, weapons and a slot for the desired weapon, both a mini-boss and final boss, and some sort of decor to the terrain so it does not end up looking too bland. For our combat system we should minimally include attacking, a health system for both the player and bosses that can decrease when being attacked and make the character die when they get to zero health.

For Sprint 2: 
  - Create our terrain and add some additional elements that fit the overall theme so we don't just have an empty flat land. 
  - import terrain assests
  - import character model
  - import movement scripts so our character can walk/run, jump
  - import at least one default weapon
  - combat actions like swinging a sword, blocking, and maybe rolling
